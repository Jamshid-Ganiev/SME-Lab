### TurtleSim Spiral Drawing Script
## Overview

This script, `turtlesimm.sh`, launches TurtleSim, a simple 2D robot simulator, and instructs a turtle to draw a captivating and colorful spiral pattern. 
The script performs the following actions:

- Launches TurtleSim within the ROS 2 environment.
- Sets the background color of the TurtleSim window.
- Guides the turtle to create a visually appealing spiral pattern by repeatedly changing its pen color, moving it forward, and turning it.
- Stops the turtle gracefully when the spiral drawing is complete.
